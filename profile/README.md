# TunnRL - Tunnel automation with reinforcement learning

This organisation is dedicated to push further the application of reinforcement learning for all kind of tunnelling problems.

It was founded in 2020 as a collaboration between the [Norwegian Geotechnical Institute](https://www.ngi.no/eng) and the [Institute of Rock Mechanics and Tunnelling](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/fmt/home/) of the Graz Unviersity of Technology.

Main contributors so far are Dr. Georg H. Erharter and Mr. Tom Frode Hansen.
